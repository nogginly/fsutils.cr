    # lists, then looked up, and every address it answers with is checked in
    # turn -- a name under the caller's control can point at anything, and
    # answering with several addresses of which one is loopback is the usual
    # way that is arranged. Checking the string alone would catch nothing.

    # at all and there is no point trying another.
